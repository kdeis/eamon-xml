  <Intro>
    Well, she's done it again. Your dinner date, the beautiful Cynthia Luxom, has stood you up.
    She probably didn't mean too; you recall she was quite excited that her nephew, Peter, was
    expected to arrive this morning for a long visit. He's a nice young man, eager to prove
    himself, and quite intelligent. Unlike his delightful but not-to-bright aunt.&#xA;&#xA;
    Still, you can't help feel bitter about it. You finish off your meal and a second mug of ale,
    then exit the tavern to contemplate whether you ought to call on her at the castle or go
    about your business until she realizes her mistake.&#xA;
    You are just passing the fountain in the village square when your stomach takes issue with
    the Calimari-for-two you ate. You sit on the edge of the pool as you feel your face flush,
    and a different kind of bitterness rises in your throat. Soon you are so occupied with the
    tasks of breathing and keeping your insides from becoming your outsides, that you barely
    notice the movement in the water.&#xA;
    Suddenly, a tentacle lashes round your forehead and pulls you in! While the cool water is
    soothing to your face and abdomen, it is decidedly unhelpful in the area of breathing.
    Frantically, you feel for your weapons, but find nothing but... a ballpoint pen.

    You descend helplessly into darkness...&#xA;
    You awaken to the sound of your alarm clock. Today is the day. You've been working towards
    this for your entire career. Today you justify all the research grants, silence all the
    skeptics, and most importantly, introduce the world to a cleaner, brighter, safer future than
    anyone else can imagine. So you'd better get to the convention center to finish preparations!

    You quickly clean up, put on your favorite lab coat, and slip your pen into the pocket.

After hosting him for dinner a few times, even Rosie has come to love him.&#xA;&#xA;More recently, Dr. Connor described him as "brilliant, but lazy." You have to admit he has become less reliable lately, sometimes disappearing for hours at a time.

        Your wife, Rosalie Octavius, is here. She is a lovely, practical woman whose face brightens the room. Her long dark hair falls lightly
        over her white lab coat the same way it did the first time you laid eyes on her, all those years ago.&#xA;
        When she sees you there, looking at her, she gently scolds you. "Otto, didn't you get my note? You go on and get ready! I'll be along soon with your coffee.

        Eastern University Energy Labs presents:
        The Future of Energy
        Safe, Secure, Sustainable
        Featuring Dr. Otto Octavius, Phd.

        It even has a picture of your smiling face - the same one Rosie picked out for the brochures.

It consists of four tentacle-like, telescoping arms, mounted on a torso harness. When you wear it, the harness inserts micro-conductors into your spinal cord (not as painful as it sounds, thankfully) and an on-board artificial intelligence interprets signals from you brain to controll the arms. A special "inhibitor chip" prevents the A. I. from trying to send its own commands back to your brain.</text>
